**Belt** is a utility library designed to simplify repetitive and tedious tasks in iOS development, often referred to as "grunt work" by developers. Like grabbing a tool from a utility belt, Belt helps handle common tasks such as photo album access, file management, location services, and permissions handling, offering easy-to-use abstractions.

**Belt** supports fast prototyping and enables developers to avoid the monotony of repetitive coding, allowing them to focus on more creative and important aspects of development. It ensures fast development speed while providing simple, reusable solutions.

Arm yourself for battle with **Belt**, the essential tool for every grunt worker.

Junior developers are encouraged to contribute to the **Belt** framework by participating in the development of example pages. This is a great opportunity to enhance your skills while contributing to the project.
